<div id="explain">
The software ganache-cli is downloaded and installed.

As you can see ganache-cli show accounts and private keys. The accounts already have ETH assigned to them.
Every time you start ganache-cli, different keys are generated. However when you use the Mnemonic you can use 
the same accounts every time, which is usefull in testing.
Also notice the port that ganache-cli is using:8545

A RPC call is made to do a simple function call, to check the version of the software. This uses the port of ganache-cli.
